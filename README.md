# Moodle plugin creator


This is a Moodle plugin Creator.
It is still in ALPHA version! If any problem shows up please create an issue with the steps followed so that I can replicate the problem
The file is extracted in the root of the Moodle (same level as config.php),requires no further installation and can be accessed by YOUR_SITE/creator/index.php

It uses the Moodle Form API and initializes the basic files for a plugin based on your choices.
At the moment only block and local plugins are supported
